                EMS builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, 
                build communities and grow businesses. These Terms govern your use of EMS, Messenger 
                and the other products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that we offer 
                (the EMS Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms 
                (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by EMS, Inc. 
                We don't charge you to use EMS or the other products and services 
                covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses and organisations pay us to show you ads for 
                their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you 
                ads that we think will be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to 
                help determine which ads to show you.
